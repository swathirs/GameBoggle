    <string name="help_text">Players have 3 minutes to select as many words of 3 or more letters as they can.
    Repeated words are not allowed. The words must be formed from sequentially adjacent cubes.
    A cube is adjacent to another if they are horizontal, vertical or diagonal neighbors.
    Words can be in singular, plural or other derived forms. Names and abbreviations are not valid.
    Each cube letter can be used only once in a single word. The score of each valid word is counted based on its length,
    1 point for 3 or 4 letter words, 2 points for 5 letter words, 3 points for 6 letter words, 5 points for 7 letter words, and
    11 points for words of 8 or more letters.</string>
