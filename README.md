# Boggle - an Android Game

Boggle Game is a timed word game developed for Android where players try to find as many connected words as possible from a random set of letters. The board is shaken to get 16 random letters. Players have three minutes (shown by the countdown timer) to find as many words as they can in the grid, according to the following rules:

* The letters must be adjoining in a 'chain'. (Letter cubes in the chain may be adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.)
Words must contain at least three letters.
* No letter cube may be used more than once within a single word.

A player submits a word by clicking on a submit button, and the program checks the submitted word and informs the player if it is valid or not. When the time is up, score will be calculated. If player's score is sufficiently high, an edit-text field pops up where they can enter their names.
